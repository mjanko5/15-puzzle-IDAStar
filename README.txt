CS 411 Hw 7 -> 15 PUZZLE Iterative Deepening A* Readme file
*To God be the Glory*

Description: Run IDA* on one initial input of a 15-puzzle.
The solution is going to be calculated, along with useful data.
If time runs out, a message will say that no solution is found.

This is the most powerful AI search for 15 puzzle I implemented, and is a mix between IDDFS and A*.
